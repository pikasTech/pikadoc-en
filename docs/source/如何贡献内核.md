# How to contribute to the kernel

### Development Conventions

- C Language Standard : c99 without gnu extensions
- Constant macros : Allowed
- Macro functions : In principle prohibited
- Macro switches : Use with caution
- Other macro functions : In principle prohibited
- Macro splicing : In principle prohibited
- Normal variable naming : Underscore naming
- Ordinary function names : Underscore names
- Object property naming : Small camel case

Note: For items prohibited in principle, if it is really necessary to use them, each use needs to be discussed separately.

- [__instruction_def.h](https://github.com/pikasTech/pikascript/blob/master/src/__instruction_def.h) - Autoly manage the VM instructions.

### Kernel development environment
#### Option 1 Development under Linux (recommended)
Linux environment recommended ubuntu20.04

installation steps:

step1: pull the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pikastech/pikascript cd pikascript/port/linux
````
step2: compile the project
```bash
sh install_dependency.sh # Install dependencies, run for the first time
sh pull-core.sh #pull the source code from the /src directory and run it for the first time
sh init.sh # run before the first compilation, no need to run after that
sh make.sh # compile the project
````
step3: run unit tests
```bash
sh gtest.sh
````
step4: run the benchmark
```bash
sh ci_benchmark.sh
````
step5: Submit source code
```bash
sh push-core.sh # Push source code to /src directory
git commit -a
git push
````
#### Scheme 2 pico real machine development
Prepare a copy of the Raspberry Pi pico development board, then clone the complete repository and use the bsp/pico-dev project in the repository.
