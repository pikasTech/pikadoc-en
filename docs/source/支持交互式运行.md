# support interactive operation
PikaScript supports reading strings directly to run Python scripts, so to support interactive operation, you only need to make a serial port receiving driver.

## Option 1: Read and run by byte (recommended)

### Implement a blocking byte read function

Interactive operation requires a low-level interface ```__platform_getchar()``` to read user input bytes. This interface is a weak function. Users need to implement a ```__platform_getchar()``` in their own code. to override this weak function.
The weak function prototype is in PikaPlatform.c. If the user does not override it, an error will be reported when using the interactive runtime.

````c
/* PikaPlatform.c */
PIKA_WEAK char __platform_getchar(void) {
    __platform_printf("[error]: __platform_getchar need impaltment!\r\n");
    while(1){
    }
}
````

Users can directly implement a ```__platform_getchar()``` in the main.c of the project.
If the platform itself supports ```getchar()```, you can directly access the platform's ```getchar()```.

````c
/* main.c */
char __platform_getchar(){
    return getchar();
}

````
If the platform does not support it, you need to implement it yourself, pay attention to implement a **blocking** ```getchar()```, that is, when there is no serial input character, you need to use ```__platform_getchar()``` waits, and returns a character if there is input.
E.g:

````c
/* main.c */
char __platform_getchar(){
    char res = 0;
    while(rx_char == 0){
    };
    res = rx_char;
    rx_char = 0;
    return res;
}

````
### Start PikaScript Shell and run pikaScriptShell() directly to start interactive operation.
```pikaScriptShell()``` The entry parameter is the root object of pika, and running ```pikaScriptInit()``` will create a root object.

````c
 pikaScriptShell(pikaScriptInit());
````

### Precautions:

#### Kernel version needs to be at least v1.3.0

#### It is strongly recommended to use putty as a serial terminal.

## Option 2: Read and run the entire line
```obj_run``` kernel API can specify an object to execute a script, and use this API to execute a **single-line** or **multi-line** script.
The following is an example of the interactive running driver of CH32. This interactive running support is written in the main loop of the firmware and starts to execute after the ```pikaScriptInit()``` initialization script is executed.

### Driven Content
#### Poll to receive characters and store them in the buffer.
#### A reception is considered complete when no new characters are received for more than 10ms.
Using the idle time to determine the completion of the transmission of the string can support interactive running of multi-line scripts. If you only need to run the single-numbered script, you can use the newline character ```'\n'``` to determine the end of the string reception. When running a single-line script, the ```'\n'``` line break can be omitted, and a multi-line script needs to have a ```'\n'``` line break. Newlines of the form ```"\r\n"``` are also supported.

#### Echo the received string after receiving.
#### Execute scripts using the ````obj_run```` kernel API.
The specified object is the root object created by the ```pikaScriptInit()``` init script, and the execution content is the received string.
#### Clean up the receive buffer.


### 2. Notes:
#### Kernel version needs to be at least v1.2.6
#### When executing a multi-line script, you need to pass in a complete code block
For example: the following script is a complete code block, especially the 4th line, which needs to have an indent of 0 to mark the end of the code block. and the last line needs to have a blank line, which means `print('the end')` with a newline at the end of the script.
````python
while a < 10:
a = a + 1
    print(a)
print('the end')

````
The following example is also possible
````python
while a < 10:
a = a + 1
    print(a)

````
The following example does not work
````python
# Missing final newline
while a < 10:
a = a + 1
    print(a)
````
````python
# The content of the while block is missing
while a < 10:

````
